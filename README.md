## ðŸ“š [LoopLang](https://loop-lang.vercel.app/)
As part of my English learning journey, I developed LoopLang, a language learning app built with Next.js and Supabase.<br>
Since I can test randomly from the selected words, phrases, and grammar points, I'm able to study effectively.

## ðŸ’° [seppan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatta_chotdog.seppan)
I developed a mobile app using React Native and Expo to manage the sharing of living expenses and various other costs between partners.<br>
Since it uses SQLite, it can be used without an internet connection.
