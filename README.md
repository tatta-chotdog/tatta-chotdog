# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a frontend engineer.<br>
I've always jumped into things that exhilarate me.<br>
Hereâ€™s about what Iâ€™m working on:

## ðŸš€ WebXR Projects
Iâ€™ve been exploring WebXR through personal projects and have published the following repositories:
### ãƒ»[webxr-cube-starter](https://github.com/tatta-chotdog/webxr-cube-starter) ###
Allows users to scale, grab, and rotate a cube in XR.
