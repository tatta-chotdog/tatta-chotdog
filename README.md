## ðŸ¥½ WebXR Projects

## ðŸ“š [LoopLang](https://loop-lang.vercel.app/)
As part of my English learning journey, I developed LoopLang, a language learning app built with Next.js and Supabase.<br>
Since I can test randomly from the selected words, phrases, and grammar points, I'm able to study effectively.

âœ… Light mode / Dark mode toggle<br>
âœ… Web and mobile responsive design

<br>

## ðŸŽ® [Pick me! Yuuki!](https://pickme-yuuki.vercel.app/)
This app was created for a friend's birthday party.<br>
It's a simple party game where the host comes up with a prompt, players submit their answers, and the host picks the best one.<br>
<br>
Thanks to the stream mode feature from playroomkit, each player can join the game using just their own smartphone.<br>
With a lively and playful design powered by anime.js, the experience stays fun and engaging throughout.<br>
All music and sound effects were also composed by me.<br>
<br>
Perfect for in-person gatherings, and just as enjoyable online via screen sharing on platforms like Discord!

## ðŸ’° [seppan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatta_chotdog.seppan)
I developed a mobile app using React Native and Expo to manage the sharing of living expenses and various other costs between partners.<br>
Since it uses SQLite, it can be used without an internet connection.
