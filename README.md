## ðŸ“š Phrase Management App: [PhraseUp](https://phrase-up-tatta-chotdogs-projects.vercel.app/)
As part of my English learning journey, I developed a **Phrase Management App** using Next.js and Supabase.<br>
Since I can test randomly from the selected phrases, I am able to study effectively myself.

<br>

## ðŸ’° Couples' Expense Sharing App: [seppan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tatta_chotdog.seppan)
I developed a mobile app using React Native and Expo to manage the sharing of living expenses and various other costs between partners.<br>
Since it uses SQLite, it can be used without an internet connection.

<br>

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Professional experience:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React
- **Currently learning:** WebXR, Three.js, React Three Fiber, Next.js, React Native

<br>

I will continue to have fun in order to become a great person!
